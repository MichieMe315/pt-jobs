<p><span>The concept for Park Integrative Health grew from our shared belief that a journey to health requires an inclusive approach. One that focuses on an individual&rsquo;s mind, body, and spiritual wellbeing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We saw a gap in service delivery for wellness treatments and a misbelief that eastern and western medical traditions cannot co-exist. We knew the system needed disruption.</span></p>
<p>In late 2017, our concept for an integrative clinic became a reality when we opened the doors of Park Integrative Health in Sherwood Park, Alberta. Since opening our clinic, we&rsquo;ve worked tirelessly to promote our message of integrative care in the Edmonton Area and beyond.</p>
<p><span>Our vision is to see the health care system move from reactionary to proactive; from operating in silos to a collaborative movement; and from separating eastern and western medicines to integrating the two with empowered patients at the centre.&nbsp;</span><em>We believe the future of health care is integrative.</em></p>
<h5>Synapse represents the growth and expansion of PIH and the culmination of over seven years of hard work, vision, and listening to what our community told us they needed. Not quite a second location, though it is physically in a separate commercial bay, Synapse by Park Integrative Health is an add-on to our existing space, an expansion of our clinic that is located a few doors down within the same complex in Sherwood Park.</h5>
<p></p>
<p>The new space represents the growth and expansion of PIH, something we&rsquo;re incredibly excited about. More than that, it&rsquo;s the culmination of over seven years of hard work, vision, and listening to what our community told us they needed. You see, we were slightly limited by the services we could offer under one roof, partly due to space restrictions and partly due to being the first fully integrative health clinic in the Edmonton Metro Area. We didn&rsquo;t know what we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But what we saw (and heard) over the years from our wonderful patients was that we needed to add more. There were some missing puzzle pieces to this wholly integrative experience, and we no longer wanted to refer patients out-of-clinic for treatments we knew we could deliver in-house. It was just a matter of some strategic planning, time, a little elbow grease, and finding the right team members to deliver on the vision.</p>
<p>When our leadership team got together to discuss ideas for &ldquo;PIH 1.5,&rdquo; we all agreed that this was the missing piece of PIH coming to life. It was the space between &mdash; not quite a fully second clinic, but an extension of our existing clinic that would offer the additional integrative health treatments our community had asked for.</p>
<p>The name for the new space came easily after that:</p>
<p><strong>SYNAPSE by Park Integrative Health.</strong></p>
<p>In Western medicine, a synapse is the point of contact between neurons where information is passed from one neuron to the next. From an Eastern medical perspective, a synapse represents the unseen energy passing through. In either case, a synapse is the space between, and that&rsquo;s exactly what &ldquo;PIH 1.5&rdquo; is going to be. It&rsquo;s a natural part of your journey through integrative wellness and a natural addition to our blossoming clinic.</p>
<p>As the ideas flowed for Synapse and we began working with designers of all types, we knew that the new space needed to be a bit different from our current clinic &mdash;&nbsp;an evolution of our existing brand. Over the coming weeks and months, you&rsquo;re going to notice some changes to the way PIH is visually presented. And we can&rsquo;t wait. But for now, here is a preview of the direction we&rsquo;re headed:</p>","Sherwood Park, AB, Canada","Sherwood Park",Alberta,Canada,,3e9ff0f29e7090c5a1377cc929c1305a,,1,"2023-12-02 01:41:07",Active,yes

<p>Our vision is clear, providing you with outstanding healthcare at an affordable price and getting you feeling better and moving better so you are able to perform at your best.</p>
<p>We at The Clinic YYC take pride in what we do. Our healthcare specialists use a team-oriented approach to treatment. Our approach is not typical, we offer one one-on-one treatment visits, multiple treatment modalities, and most importantly, treatment visits that are not rushed.</p>
<p>Our specialists take the time to explain to you the causes and symptoms of your injury, provide you with a descriptive diagnosis, cater to your treatment goals, and ensure you have a prevention plan.</p>
<p>Our goal is not just to treat the causes and symptoms of your injury, but also to discover the underlying root problem and how to treat it so it does not become a recurring injury.</p>
<p>We want to see our patients<span>&nbsp;</span><b>activate their own health</b></p>
<h3>How are we different?</h3>
<p>Communication: our model of patient-centered care is one of integration. We believe in open dialogue and active, regular communication with other health care providers; from medical specialists to alternative health care providers to strength and conditioning specialists.</p>
<p>Quality of Care: we do not believe in assembly-line style, cookie-cutter, one-tool-fits-all-care. Each of our appointment times are 20-30 minutes of one-on-one care with your practitioner. This allows adequate time to re-assess, adapt, and progress your care each visit.</p>
<p>Leadership is action: each of our practitioners embraces an active lifestyle. We do not ask or recommend anything of our patients that we haven&rsquo;t tried, experienced, or challenged ourselves</p>
<h3>How do we measure success?</h3>
<p>We measure success when a patient walks out happy and feeling better than when they arrived. We measure success when a patient is pain-free from recurring injury or chronic pain. We measure success when a patient refers other prospective patients to us, letting them know about the amazing experience they had at The Clinic YYC.

<p><span>From massage therapy to chiropractic treatment, from sports injuries to acupuncture, and from coping with work injuries to recovery lounges, we assure better physical health for the distressed. Apart from our wellness clinic, we serve to provide a co-working clinic where potential people from different sectors can work in harmony and silence.</span></p>
<p><span>We acknowledge that physical fitness is the essential aspect that leads to complaisance; hence, our wellness clinic has been oriented to serve and empower the community and resolve all possible physical fitness concerns.

<h3>We not only work together, we learn together through regular team meetings and clinical rounds so that we all can learn from each other and enrich our knowledge about sport and exercise medicine, and musculoskeletal conditions that affect our clients.</h3>
<p>When someone gets injured or is affected by a musculoskeletal condition that is changing the way they are functioning on a day to day basis, it is hard to know where to turn for help.&nbsp; Additionally, it is hard to know which of the many different rehabilitation therapies would best help resolve the issue or injury.</p>
<p>Having a comprehensive team that collaborates together when it comes to patient care means that we are a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for your rehabilitative care.</p>
<p>We work together to ensure that our patients reap the benefits of our collective knowledge about the human body and how it moves.</p>
<p>Our sports medicine physicians at Reactivate Muskoka act as the diagnosticians to clarify a client&rsquo;s diagnosis. They take the time to talk with our clients and learn about their concerns, to tease out the exact ways in which their lives are affected. Then with an enhanced physical exam they can further hone in on what is going on, and offer treatments or further imaging if required.</p>
<p>At the end of a sports medicine consultation, a more precise diagnosis will be available to our clients. Our rehabilitative team of physiotherapists, chiropractors, massage therapists and kinesiologists can help formulate a movement based treatment and exercise plan for our clients to engage in.</p>
<p>Often there is overlap between physiotherapy, massage therapy, and chiropractic therapy. This allows for each of these specialty areas to complement one other, thereby augmenting the effect of each individual form of therapy. It gives new meaning to &ldquo;We are stronger together&rdquo;.</p>

<h3><span>Our </span>Philosophy</h3>
<p>We believe that the body wants to, and has the innate ability to be healthy. Often though, over time, the body loses its ability to efficiently self-regulate and self-heal. Some of this loss may be due to the aging process, illness, trauma, surgical scarring, childbirth, repetitive activity, the prolonged influence of gravity on posture, or the cumulative effects of mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual stresses.</p>
<p>Every body, no matter their current level of health and fitness, can improve their health whether it be through therapeutic hands-on treatment, preventative or restorative exercise, education regarding lifestyle and activities, discussion about how to reconcile and move forward after experiencing a loss, or through hands-off energy work. Many people discover that a combination of therapies and lifestyle changes are beneficial as they strive to achieve their peak health and wellness.</p>","Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada","Mahone Bay","Nova Scotia",Canada,,6cfbde4bed23f1fb3b266085d376d0e2,,1,"2019-10-28 13:40:27",Active,no

<p><strong>Functional Neurology</strong> is the application of brain based rehab which integrates the study and application of neuroscience and biomechanics. &nbsp;An alteration to the brain or body due to a biomechanics, inflammatory or neurological insult results in a change in function not just to the brain but to many areas of the body. These changes result in inappropriate information being sent to the relay centers of the brain. This can cause symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, double vision, spasticity, hypotonia, neurodevelopmental delay, changes in gait etc.; it&rsquo;s an ongoing negative feedback mechanism, unless the information being relayed is corrected.</p>
<p>The <strong>Vestibular System</strong> is responsible for regulating balance, movement, muscle control, posture and eye position and stability. &nbsp;The vestibular system is most often one of the major culprits in the sensory mismatch of feedback to our brain. By using sensory, motor and receptor based applications we can improve pathways to the brain which have become altered due to inappropriate feedback. Treatments are intended to integrate brain functioning and retrain the parts of the nervous system that may be malfunctioning by creating neuroplasticity. Treatment is not a&rdquo; one size fits all&rdquo; approach. Rehabilitation programs are dependent on your exam findings. The longer someone&rsquo;s brain is adapting to negative changes, the longer it will take to rehabilitate their way out of it.</p>","Burlington, ON, Canada",Burlington,Ontario,Canada,,996d1a1509fa223f78ac0803d20f2631,,2,"2019-05-04 08:25:27",Active,no

<p>Willow Health was built on the principles that all people deserve high quality, one-on-one treatment sessions.</p>
<p>To achieve this vision, Willow Health has distinguished itself by:</p>
<ul><li>Offering the<span> </span><strong>longest assessment and treatment times</strong><span> </span>in Chatham</li>
<li>Having practitioners who are dedicated to pursuing<span> </span><strong>current and advanced education</strong>, with physiotherapists who have worked and trained internationally.</li>
<li>Partnering with<span> </span><strong>Universities across Ontario </strong>to collaborate in research and provide clinical education opportunities for allied healthcare practitioners to learn under Willow Health practitioners.</li>
<li>Providing<span> </span><strong>only hands-on therapy, active one-on-one training, and evidenced-based modalities</strong>, not leaving patients unattended or plugging them in to passive devices.</li>
<li>Providing<span> </span><strong>educational lectures</strong><span> </span>for surgeons, family doctors, nurses, midwives, and the community of Chatham-Kent to<span> </span><strong>advocate</strong><span> </span>for the evidenced-based role of physiotherapy and counselling in managing pain and addressing Women’s Health concerns.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of this model of care, Willow Health has grown significantly.  It provides complete physiotherapy care for both men and women.  It uses best-practice research to address many common orthopaedic concerns, including</p>

<p>We assess and treat all kinds of injuries and conditions, from head to toe! We also see clients with WCB (Workers Compensation Board) or motor vehicle claims. </p>
<p>Other clinics might offer the same services, but clients come to us because of the personal touch we provide. They know we care about them as a person, not as a statistic. From the moment they walk in the door, they are greeted by name, with a smile and maybe even a joke or two. If they’ve seen us before, they will feel like Norm walking into Cheers! If they are new to us, they immediately feel welcomed and looked after.</p>
<p>On their first visit, the front end staff will help them fill out any forms we might need and let them know what to expect when the therapist brings them back. Therapists greet each new patient with a handshake and a smile while introducing ourselves. We help them to understand their condition and the treatments needed. We help them understand that their homework is important to recovery. Our ideal client is interested in being part of the plan. They want to know what they can do to help themselves, not just have things done to them. </p>

<h3>WHY WE EXIST</h3>
<p><span>Physiotherapy has been characterized by a therapist doing 'something' to you to decrease pain or help you move better. This strategy is effective in the short term but it lacks long-term results. Long-term results come from active approaches that change the way a person moves habitually. We decided to open Adventure Physiotherapy to follow recent shifts toward evidence-informed rehabilitation and develop a clinic from the ground up that allows us to pursue excellence. </span></p>
